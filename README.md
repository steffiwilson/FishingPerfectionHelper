This is in final testing stages now. Probably does not support fish from expansion mods (as I have been told they may not appear in Data/Fish but only Data/Locations). 

Press the V key to view a list of the fish you can catch now that you haven't caught yet (can be remapped to a different keybind using Generic Mod Config Menu). Hides fish that require different seasons, weather, times, or are unavailable due to your fishing level, map unlocks, community center completion, etc. Fish that can only be caught in the rain will be indicated as such in the list, to help you prioritize. To help out earlier in the save, the list is sorted from easiest catch to hardest.
