This is in final testing stages now. Probably does not support fish from expansion mods (as I have been told they may not appear in Data/Fish but only Data/Locations). 

Press the V key to view a list of the fish you can catch now that you haven't caught yet (can be remapped to a different keybind using Generic Mod Config Menu). Hides fish that require different seasons, weather, times, or are unavailable due to your fishing level, map unlocks, community center completion, etc. Fish that can only be caught in the rain will be indicated as such in the list, to help you prioritize. To help out earlier in the save, the list is sorted from easiest catch to hardest. 

I'm guessing this doesn't work correctly for fish that have multiple catch windows, as the Data/Fish dictionary I pull the fish data from seems to only have one window (note to self: double check what you get from Albacore in the raw fish data as an example of a multi-window fish.) Hopefully this will always return truthful data (if it says you can catch a fish, you can) even if it is not always complete (perhaps it will not say you can catch a fish, when maybe you could, but it does suggest that you catch it under other valid conditions).
